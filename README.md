* **If you want to get started, I recommend referring to the *Accepted Papers with the Released Code*, as it provides an easy way to explore research papers and their associated code implementations. 
Furthermore, building your algorithm on top of state-of-the-art algorithms will greatly enhance your productivity and efficiency.**



* If you are interested in sequential decision-making problems, it is recommended to focus primarily on **EA-Assisted Optimization of RL** and **Synergistic Optimization of EA and RL**. If you are interested in other optimization problems, it is suggested to pay attention to **RL-Assisted Optimization of EA**. I primarily focus on the former.
