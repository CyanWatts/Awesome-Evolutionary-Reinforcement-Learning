Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL), which integrates Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for optimization, has demonstrated remarkable performance advancements. By fusing the strengths of both approaches, ERL has emerged as a promising research direction.

* **If you want to get started, I recommend referring to the *Accepted Papers with the Released Code*, as it provides an easy way to explore research papers and their associated code implementations. 
Furthermore, building your algorithm on top of state-of-the-art algorithms will greatly enhance your productivity and efficiency.**



* If you are interested in sequential decision-making problems, it is recommended to focus primarily on **EA-Assisted Optimization of RL** and **Synergistic Optimization of EA and RL**. If you are interested in other optimization problems, it is suggested to pay attention to **RL-Assisted Optimization of EA**. I primarily focus on the former.
