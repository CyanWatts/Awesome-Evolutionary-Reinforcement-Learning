A list of recent papers regarding the combining Evolutionary Algorithms and Reinforcement Learning. They are sorted by time to see the recent papers first.
I will renew the recent papers and add notes to these papers.

**If you want to get started, I recommend referring to the *Accpeted Papers with the Released Code*, as it provides an easy way to explore research papers along with their associated code implementations. 
Furthermore, building your algorithm on top of state-of-the-art algorithms will greatly enhance your productivity and efficiency.**

**12 June 2023**: Update more papers about Single Agent Policy Optimization and some papers about Quality Diversity RL. 

**I will update other related papers and codes before 10 June 2023, including more papers about Policy Optimization, Quality-Diversity EA + RL , Meta EA + RL, Transfer EA + RL ...**
